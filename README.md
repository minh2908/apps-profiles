# Which app should you build? An analysis on the most profitable app profiles on the AppStore and Google Play Store

In this project, we use basic Python techniques to analyze the app profiles on the AppStore and Google Play Store. We provide an answer to the question: what app should developers build to stand out and succeed? 

Especially, we focus on the free-app market, which means the market for apps users can download for free. The revenue model for these apps is the in-app advertisement. As a result, it is desirable to get as many users for the apps as possible. By analyzing a dataset of more than 18,000 apps on the AppStore and Google Play Store, we will try to find out which kinds of apps are likely to attract users.
